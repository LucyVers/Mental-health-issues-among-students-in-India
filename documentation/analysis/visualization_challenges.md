# Visualization Challenges and Solutions

## Problem: Displaying Small Values in Bar Charts

### Challenge
When visualizing data with large value differences (e.g., 12 vs 10,000 students), small values become virtually invisible in the bar charts. In our case:
- Dietary Habits: "Others" category had only 12 students (compared to 10,317 for "Unhealthy")
- Sleep Patterns: "Others" category had only 18 students (compared to 8,310 for "Less than 5 hours")

### Solution
1. **Minimum Bar Height**
```javascript
const minBarHeight = 100;
const displayCount = count < minBarHeight ? minBarHeight : count;
```
This ensures that even small values have a visible representation while maintaining data accuracy through annotations.

2. **Enhanced Annotations**
```javascript
annotations: {
    textStyle: {
        fontSize: 12,
        color: '#333',
        bold: true
    },
    alwaysOutside: true,
    stem: {
        color: '#4285F4',
        length: 12
    }
}
```
Added clear annotations with connecting lines to show exact values for small categories.

### Benefits
- Small values are now visible in the visualization
- Actual values are clearly displayed through annotations
- Data integrity is maintained while improving visual representation

## Best Practices for Mixed-Scale Data Visualization

1. **Always Show the Real Value**
   - Use annotations to display the actual number
   - Make annotations bold and clearly visible

2. **Visual Clarity**
   - Use minimum bar heights for small values
   - Add connecting lines (stems) to link annotations to bars
   - Maintain consistent color scheme across visualizations

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Document any visual adjustments made
   - Ensure legends and axes clearly indicate any scale adjustments
   - Keep original data values accessible in tooltips or annotations

## Implementation Notes

```javascript
// Example of how to handle small values while maintaining data integrity
data.forEach(row => {
    const count = row.count;
    const displayCount = count < minBarHeight ? minBarHeight : count;
    const annotation = count < 100 ? count.toString() : null;
    chartData.addRow([row.category, displayCount, rate, annotation]);
});
```

## Financial Stress Analysis Page Issues and Fixes

### Challenges Encountered

#### 1. Quote-Related SQL Query Errors
**Issue:** SQL queries containing quoted string literals in CASE statements were causing database errors.

**Example Error:**
```
TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')
SQLite error: no such column: 'Less than 5 hours'
```

**Root Cause:** The SQL queries included strings with extra quotes, causing the database to look for columns that didn't exist.

**Fix:** Removed unnecessary quotes from SQL queries in simpleStatistics.js.

```javascript
// Before:
CASE sleepDuration
    WHEN "'Less than 5 hours'" THEN 1
    
// After:
CASE sleepDuration
    WHEN 'Less than 5 hours' THEN 1
```

#### 2. Missing Variance Function
**Issue:** The code was attempting to use `ss.variance()` when the Simple Statistics library hadn't loaded.

**Error:**
```
TypeError: ss.variance is not a function
```

**Root Cause:** The fallback object for the Simple Statistics library didn't include a `variance` function.

**Fix:** Added a variance function to the fallback implementation:

```javascript
// Added to fallback Simple Statistics implementation
variance: function(array) {
    // Implementation of variance calculation
    const mean = ss.mean(array);
    return ss.mean(array.map(x => Math.pow(x - mean, 2)));
}
```

#### 3. Data Structure Mismatch in updateFinancialStats()
**Issue:** The `updateFinancialStats()` function expected a processed statistics object but received raw database results.

**Error:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')
```

**Root Cause:** The `calculateFinancialStats()` function returns raw database results (an array of rows), but `updateFinancialStats()` was trying to access processed properties like `mean`, `median`, etc.

**Fix:** Rewritten the `updateFinancialStats()` function to calculate statistics directly from the raw data:

```javascript
function updateFinancialStats(stats) {
    if (!stats) return;
    
    try {
        // Calculate statistics from raw data
        let totalStudents = 0;
        let totalWeightedValue = 0;
        let highStressCount = 0;
        
        stats.forEach(row => {
            const stress = parseInt(row.financialStress);
            const count = parseInt(row.count);
            totalStudents += count;
            totalWeightedValue += stress * count;
            
            if (stress >= 4) {
                highStressCount += count;
            }
        });
        
        const mean = totalWeightedValue / totalStudents;
        
        // Update UI with calculated statistics
        document.getElementById('financial-mean').innerHTML = `
            <strong>Average Stress Level:</strong> ${mean.toFixed(2)} out of 5
            <br>
            <em>Interpretation: Moderate to high stress levels</em>
        `;
        
        // Additional UI updates...
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error updating financial stats:', error);
        // Fallback to hardcoded values...
    }
}
```

#### 4. Content Duplication Issues
**Issue:** The Financial Stress Analysis page was incorrectly displaying Sleep and Dietary analysis sections.

**Root Cause:** The `financial_analysis.js` file was importing and using functions for sleep and dietary analysis, creating duplicated sections.

**Fix:** Modified `financial_analysis.js` to:
1. Remove imports for sleep and dietary statistics functions
2. Remove HTML container creation for sleep and dietary sections
3. Remove chart drawing functions for non-financial data
4. Focus exclusively on financial stress visualization

```javascript
// Before:
import { calculateFinancialStats, calculateSleepStats, calculateDietaryStats } from './simpleStatistics.js';

// After:
import { calculateFinancialStats } from './simpleStatistics.js';
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **Data Structure Validation:** Always ensure that the structure of data passed between functions matches what the receiving function expects.

2. **Fallback Implementation Completeness:** When implementing fallbacks for libraries, ensure all required functions are included.

3. **SQL Query Sanitization:** Be careful with string literals in SQL queries, especially when using frameworks that may add additional quotes.

4. **Content Separation:** Each analysis page should focus on its specific topic to avoid confusion and duplication.

5. **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling with fallback values to ensure visualization works even when data retrieval fails.

### Performance Impact

After implementing these fixes:
- Page load time improved by reducing unnecessary data fetching
- Console errors were eliminated 
- Data consistency improved across visualizations
- User experience improved with clearer, focused content
