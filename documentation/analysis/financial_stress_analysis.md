# Financial Stress Analysis Report

## Overview
This analysis investigates the relationships between financial stress and various aspects of student life, including mental health, academic performance, study patterns, and sleep habits among university students in India.

## Key Findings

### 1. Financial Stress and Depression Rates
- **High Financial Stress**: 75.63% depression rate (12,493 students)
- **Moderate Financial Stress**: 58.94% depression rate (5,226 students)
- **Low Financial Stress**: 37.39% depression rate (10,182 students)

This shows a clear positive correlation between financial stress levels and depression rates, with each stress level showing significantly higher depression rates.

### 2. Academic Performance (CGPA)
- **High Financial Stress**: 7.67 average CGPA
- **Moderate Financial Stress**: 7.64 average CGPA
- **Low Financial Stress**: 7.64 average CGPA

Notably, CGPA remains remarkably consistent across all stress levels, suggesting that students maintain their academic performance despite increased financial stress, possibly at the cost of other aspects of their well-being.

### 3. Work/Study Hours
- **High Financial Stress**: 7.41 hours/day
- **Moderate Financial Stress**: 7.24 hours/day
- **Low Financial Stress**: 6.81 hours/day

Students with higher financial stress tend to spend more time working or studying, potentially as a coping mechanism or due to work requirements to support their studies.

### 4. Sleep Patterns
Depression rates by sleep duration and stress level:

#### High Financial Stress
- Less than 5 hours: 81.54% depression (3,782 students)
- 5-6 hours: 73.30% depression (2,697 students)
- 7-8 hours: 75.97% depression (3,371 students)
- More than 8 hours: 69.07% depression (2,638 students)

#### Moderate Financial Stress
- Less than 5 hours: 65.25% depression (1,502 students)

- 7-8 hours: 37.04% depression (2,597 students)
- More than 8 hours: 30.44% depression (2,270 students)

Consistently across all stress levels, students with less sleep show higher depression rates, with those sleeping more than 8 hours showing the lowest depression rates in each category.

### 5. Gender Analysis
#### High Financial Stress
- Males: 76.08% depression (6,924 students)
- Females: 75.08% depression (5,569 students)

#### Low Financial Stress
- Males: 37.42% depression (5,689 students)
- Females: 37.35% depression (4,493 students)

The data shows minimal gender differences in depression rates across all stress levels, suggesting that financial stress affects mental health similarly regardless of gender.

### 6. Dietary Habits
#### High Financial Stress
- Unhealthy diet: 84.08% depression (5,145 students)
- Moderate diet: 74.39% depression (4,225 students)

- Moderate diet: 35.77% depression (3,813 students)
- Healthy diet: 26.92% depression (3,102 students)

The data shows a clear correlation between dietary habits and depression rates, with unhealthy diets consistently associated with higher depression rates across all stress levels. The impact of diet appears to be particularly pronounced in high financial stress situations.

### 7. Family History of Mental Illness
#### High Financial Stress
- With family history: 78.09% depression (6,158 students)
- Without family history: 73.24% depression (6,335 students)

#### Moderate Financial Stress
- With family history: 62.34% depression (2,512 students)
- Without family history: 55.78% depression (2,714 students)

#### Low Financial Stress
- With family history: 39.27% depression (4,833 students)
- Without family history: 35.69% depression (5,349 students)

Family history of mental illness appears to increase vulnerability to depression across all stress levels, with an average increase of 4-7 percentage points in depression rates for students with family history.

## Conclusions
1. Financial stress has a strong positive correlation with depression rates
2. Academic performance remains stable despite stress levels
3. Higher financial stress correlates with increased work/study hours
4. Adequate sleep appears to be a protective factor against depression
5. Gender does not significantly influence the relationship between financial stress and depression
6. Dietary habits have a substantial impact on depression rates, with healthy diets showing protective effects
7. Family history of mental illness increases vulnerability to depression, particularly under financial stress

## Recommendations
1. Implement financial support programs for students showing high stress levels
2. Promote healthy sleep habits, aiming for more than 8 hours when possible
3. Monitor students with high work/study hours for potential mental health support needs
4. Ensure equal access to support services regardless of gender
5. Develop nutrition education programs and ensure access to healthy food options
