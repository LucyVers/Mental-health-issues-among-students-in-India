## System Structure

The Indian higher education system is one of the largest globally, serving 43.2 million students. My research shows that the system follows a "10+2+3" pattern:
- 10 years of primary and secondary education
- 2 years of higher secondary education
- 3 or more years of higher education

### Institutional Framework

The system is organized in a three-layered structure:
1. Universities
2. Colleges
3. Specialized Courses

Key characteristics I've identified:
- Universities and specialized institutes serve as centers for higher education
- Most institutions function autonomously
- English is the primary medium of instruction
- Federal structure with affiliated colleges and university departments

### Growth and Development

My analysis of the system's growth reveals:
- Enrollment increased from 30 million (2012-13) to 43.2 million (2021-22)
- Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.1%
- Significant expansion in both capacity and recognition

## Academic Structure

### Program Types
- Undergraduate programs (typically 3-4 years)
- Postgraduate programs (2-3 years)
- Doctoral studies
  * Generally unpaid positions
  * Monthly stipend of approximately 25,000 INR

### Cost Structure

Based on my research, costs vary by institution and field:
- Typical annual tuition: $3,300 to $7,800
- Higher costs for specialized programs (medicine, engineering)
- Additional expenses for:
  * Accommodation
  * Books and materials
  * Living expenses

## Financial Support Systems

### Educational Loans
- SBI Scholar Loan Scheme for premier institutions
- Standard student loan options
- Interest subsidy schemes:
  * Dr. Ambedkar Interest Subsidy Scheme
  * Padho Pardesh Interest Subsidy Scheme

### Scholarships
