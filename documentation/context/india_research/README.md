## Connection to Data Analysis

As I collect research, think about how this context helps explain:
- Why financial stress correlates so strongly with depression
- What social factors might contribute to sleep patterns
- How dietary habits relate to the broader Indian context
- Any unique aspects of mental health in Indian universities

This contextual information will be integrated into my final analysis to create a more comprehensive understanding of the data findings.
