# Analysis Methods

## Statistical Analysis Plan

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Frequency distributions
- Central tendency measures
- Dispersion measures
- Visual representations (histograms, box plots)

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between:
  - Financial Stress and Depression (r = 0.71, p < 0.001)
  - Sleep Duration and Depression (r = -0.54, p < 0.001)
  - Dietary Habits and Depression (r = -0.48, p < 0.001)
  - Academic Pressure and Depression (r = 0.43, p < 0.001)
- Correlation matrices
- Bar chart visualization of correlations

### 3. Normality Tests
- Analysis of:
  - Financial Stress Distribution (approximately normal, skewness = -0.13)
  - Sleep Duration Distribution (approximately normal, skewness = 0.08)
- Histogram analysis
- Skewness and kurtosis calculations

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- T-tests for Financial Stress:
  - Null Hypothesis: No difference in depression rates between high and low financial stress groups
  - Alternative Hypothesis: Higher depression rates in high financial stress group
  - Results: 
    - t = 63.0270 (p < 0.001)
    - Low Stress (1-2): 37.39% depression rate
    - High Stress (4-5): 75.64% depression rate
    - Statistically significant difference
    - 102.31% increase in depression risk

### 5. Data Visualization
- Google Charts implementation:
  - Distribution histograms
  - Depression rate comparisons
  - Correlation bar charts
- Interactive features
- Filtering capabilities
- Dynamic updates

## Research Questions
1. Is there a significant relationship between financial stress and depression?
2. How do sleep patterns correlate with depression?
3. What is the impact of dietary habits on mental health?
4. How does academic pressure relate to depression?
