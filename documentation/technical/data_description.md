## Overview
This dataset contains responses from a survey conducted among university students in India, focusing on mental health and related factors. The data has been processed and analyzed as part of my research project.

## Dataset Details
- Source: Survey of university students in India
- Size: 27,900 responses
- Format: CSV (converted to SQLite for analysis)
- Collection Period: March 2025
- Geographic Coverage: India

## Data Structure Implementation (April 1, 2025)

### Column Specifications
1. id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
2. gender (TEXT)
3. age (REAL)
4. city (TEXT)
5. profession (TEXT)
6. academicPressure (REAL)
7. workPressure (REAL)
8. cgpa (REAL)
9. studySatisfaction (REAL)
10. jobSatisfaction (REAL)
11. sleepDuration (TEXT)
12. dietaryHabits (TEXT)
13. degree (TEXT)
14. suicidalThoughts (TEXT) - Values: "Yes"/"No"
15. workStudyHours (REAL) - Combined hours for work and study
16. financialStress (REAL) - Numeric value representing stress level
17. familyHistoryMentalIllness (TEXT) - Values: "Yes"/"No"
18. depression (INTEGER) - Binary indicator (1/0)

### Data Type Implementation
- TEXT for categorical variables (gender, city, profession, etc.)
- REAL for numeric measurements (age, pressure levels, satisfaction scores)
- INTEGER for binary outcomes (depression)
- Original Yes/No format maintained for categorical binary variables

### Implementation Notes
- Combined Work/Study Hours column maintained for data integrity
- Financial Stress implemented as numeric value for statistical analysis
- Yes/No responses preserved in original format
- Depression stored as INTEGER for binary outcome analysis

## Data Processing
- Initial data import completed
- Data validation performed
- Quality checks implemented
- Transformation rules established

## Data Quality Verification
- Verified all Yes/No fields maintain original format
- Ensured no NULL values in depression column
- Validated numeric ranges for all REAL fields
- Confirmed data integrity after import

## Implementation Notes
- All transformations documented
- Original data formats preserved where possible
- Changes tracked and justified

## Data Transformation Implementation

### Column Naming Standards
- Implemented camelCase for all column names
- Removed spaces and special characters
- Maintained descriptive but concise naming
- Examples of implemented transformations:
  - "Sleep Duration" → sleepDuration
  - "Study Time" → studyTime
  - "Work Load" → workLoad

### Data Type Transformations
1. Sleep Duration:
   - Current: Text-based data
   - Transformation: Convert to numeric ranges
   - Example: "Less than 5 hours" → 1, "5-7 hours" → 2, etc.

2. Work/Study Hours:
   - Original: Combined "Work/Study Hours" column
   - Decision: Split into two separate columns
   - Rationale:
     - Enables separate analysis of work and study impact
     - Allows for better understanding of time distribution
     - Facilitates correlation analysis between work hours, study hours, and depression
     - Helps identify patterns in different student groups (full-time students vs. working students)
   - Implementation:
     - studyHours (REAL): Hours spent on academic activities
     - workHours (REAL): Hours spent on employment
   - Benefits:
     - More detailed analysis possibilities
     - Better data granularity
     - Clearer insights into student workload distribution
     - Enhanced ability to study work-study balance effects

### Import Process
1. Create SQLite database
2. Design table structure following naming conventions
3. Import CSV data using SQLiteStudio's import wizard
4. Transform data types where needed
5. Validate data integrity

## Data Import Results (April 1, 2025)
### Implementation Verification
- Total records processed: 27,901
- Data integrity verified for all columns
- Data formats implemented as specified:
  - familyHistoryMentalIllness: Text format ("Yes"/"No")
  - financialStress: Numeric values maintained
  - depression: Integer values (no NULL values)
  - workStudyHours: Single column with combined hours

### Implementation Progress
1. Initial data analysis completed
2. Database indexes created for performance
3. Statistical analysis framework implemented

## Quality Assurance Results
- All columns verified with correct data types
- NULL value checks completed
- Text field formatting verified
- Numeric field validation completed
- Binary field format verification completed
