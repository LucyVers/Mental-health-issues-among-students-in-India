# Dietary Habits and Mental Health: Analysis and Findings

## Overview
This analysis examines the relationship between dietary habits and mental health among Indian university students. We have analyzed three main aspects:
1. Distribution of dietary habits and mental health indicators
2. Relationship between dietary habits, sleep patterns, and depression
3. Connection between dietary habits, academic performance, and depression

## Key Findings

- High-performing students (CGPA â‰¥8.0):
  - Healthy dietary habits: 47.39% depression
  - Moderate dietary habits: 58.70% depression

## Conclusions

3. Academic performance is negatively affected by unhealthy dietary habits, regardless of performance level
4. Pressure levels gradually increase with poorer dietary habits

## Recommendations
1. Implement programs to promote healthy dietary habits on campus
2. Raise awareness about the connection between diet, sleep, and mental health
3. Provide support and resources for students to improve their dietary habits
4. Integrate dietary advice into existing mental health programs
