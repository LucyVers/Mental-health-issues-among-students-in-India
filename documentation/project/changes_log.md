## Background
The project faced an issue where Part 1 and Part 2 were conflicting due to sharing the same `simpleStatistics.js` file while using different JavaScript module systems:
- Part 1 (`financial-analysis.html`): Uses global window assignments
- Part 2 (`/#financial-stress-analysis`): Uses ES6 modules (import/export)

## Changes Made

### 1. Restored Original simpleStatistics.js (for Part 1)
- Removed the `export` statement
- Kept only the window assignments:
  ```javascript
  window.calculateFinancialStats = calculateFinancialStats;
  window.calculateSleepStats = calculateSleepStats;
  window.calculateDietaryStats = calculateDietaryStats;
  ```
- This file is now exclusively used by Part 1

### 2. Created New Module for Part 2
Created new file `financial-stress-module.js` containing:
- The financial stress analysis functionality
- ES6 module exports
- Helper functions specific to financial stress analysis
- Exported functions:
  ```javascript
  export { calculateFinancialStats, interpretStressLevel };
  ```

### 3. Updated Part 2's Import
Modified `financial_analysis.js` to:
- Import from the new module instead of simpleStatistics.js
- Use the new data structure returned by the module
- Import both main function and helper functions:
  ```javascript
  import { calculateFinancialStats, interpretStressLevel } from './financial-stress-module.js';
  ```

## Current Status
- Part 1 (`http://localhost:3005/financial-analysis.html`): Working correctly
- Part 2 (`http://localhost:3005/#financial-stress-analysis`): Working correctly
- Both parts now operate independently without conflicts

## File Structure
```
statistics-template-5/
├── js/
│   ├── simpleStatistics.js          # Used by Part 1 (window assignments)
│   ├── financial-stress-module.js    # Used by Part 2 (ES6 module)
│   └── financial_analysis.js         # Updated to use new module
```

## Development Notes
1. Maintaining Separation:
   - Part 1: Use files with window assignments
   - Part 2: Use ES6 modules with import/export

2. Feature Implementation Guidelines:
   - Part 1: Add to simpleStatistics.js with window assignments
   - Part 2: Add to appropriate module files with exports

3. Testing Protocol:
   - Test both Part 1 and Part 2 after changes
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all charts and statistics display correctly
