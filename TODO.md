## üìù Development Notes

### Important Reminders
- Always shut down server between tests (avoid EADDRINUSE)
- Keep DEL1 and DEL2 implementations separate:
  - DEL1: Uses standalone HTML files (e.g., financial-analysis.html)
  - DEL2: Uses SPA routing (e.g., /#financial-stress-analysis)

### Project Status
- All VG requirements for DEL2 have been implemented
- Multi-page website structure is complete
- Advanced statistical analysis is implemented and working
- Social context research is integrated with data analysis
