## Notes
- DEL1 is now complete with all requirements fulfilled!
- DEL2 requires creating a multi-page website with interactive elements
- Advanced statistical analysis including t-tests and normal distribution tests are needed
- The social context of Indian university education must be researched and integrated
- Need to focus on creating a cohesive story across multiple pages while maintaining scientific rigor
- All changes should be committed regularly to the GitHub repository
