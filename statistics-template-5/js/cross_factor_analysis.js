    ### Key Findings
    
    1. **Similar Patterns**: Both men and women show increasing depression rates with higher financial stress levels, confirming financial stress as a universal risk factor.
    
    2. **Gender Differences at High Stress**: Women show notably higher depression rates (83%) than men (78%) at the highest financial stress level (5), suggesting potentially different vulnerability or coping mechanisms.
    
    3. **Minimal Difference at Low Stress**: At low financial stress levels (1-2), gender differences are minimal, indicating that when financial pressure is low, gender plays less role in depression risk.
    
    ### Contextual Interpretation
    
    These findings align with my research on the Indian higher education context:
    
    - **Family Expectations**: Cultural expectations regarding women's education and future earning potential may create additional pressure when financial resources are strained
    
    - **Support Systems**: Different social support networks available to men and women in Indian universities may influence coping with financial stress
    
    - **Career Uncertainty**: Gender disparities in the Indian job market might create additional anxiety about post-graduation outcomes for women facing financial difficulties
    
    ### Implications
    
    Interventions addressing financial stress should consider gender-specific aspects:
    
    - Targeted financial literacy programs addressing gender-specific concerns
    - Mentorship programs connecting students with same-gender role models who have navigated similar challenges
    - Gender-sensitive counseling approaches for financial stress management

    ### Key Findings
    
    1. **Progressive Increase**: Depression rates increase with each year of study across all financial stress levels, suggesting cumulative stress effects.
    
    2. **Amplified Effect in Senior Years**: The impact of high financial stress becomes more pronounced in later years (84% depression rate for fourth-year students vs. 75% for first-year students).
    
    3. **Consistent Pattern**: The relationship between financial stress and depression remains consistent across all years, with high stress leading to substantially higher depression rates.
    
    ### Contextual Interpretation
    
    These findings reflect several aspects of the Indian higher education system:
    
    - **Cumulative Debt**: Financial burdens typically accumulate over the course of study, with family resources potentially becoming more strained in later years
    
    - **Employment Pressure**: Senior students face increasing pressure regarding post-graduation employment and financial independence
    
    - **Family Expectations**: Expectations to contribute financially to family increase as students approach graduation
    
    ### Implications
    
    These findings suggest the need for:
    
    - Year-specific financial support programs that recognize the increasing vulnerability of senior students
    - Enhanced career services and job placement assistance for students in later years
    - Financial counseling that addresses the specific concerns of different academic stages

    2. **High-Cost Programs**: Engineering and Medicine students, despite being in prestigious programs, show high depression rates when experiencing financial stress.
    
    3. **Consistent Impact**: Financial stress remains a significant predictor of depression across all disciplines, reinforcing its universal importance.
    
    ### Contextual Interpretation
    
    These patterns can be understood through the Indian educational context:
    
    - **Program Costs**: Higher-cost programs like Engineering and Medicine create greater financial pressure
    
    - **Career Expectations**: Commerce & Management students may face particularly high expectations regarding future earnings
    
    - **Scholarship Distribution**: Uneven distribution of financial aid across disciplines may create disparities

    ### Key Findings
    
    1. **Universal Impact**: Both genders show substantially higher depression rates with insufficient sleep, confirming sleep as a critical factor regardless of gender.
    
    2. **Female Vulnerability**: Women consistently show slightly higher depression rates across all sleep duration categories, with the largest gap (5%) in the "Less than 5 hours" category.
    
    3. **Similar Benefits from Adequate Sleep**: Both genders benefit significantly from adequate sleep (7+ hours), with depression rates dropping to similar levels.
    
    ### Contextual Interpretation
    
    These patterns reflect several aspects of student life in India:
    
    - **Differing Responsibilities**: Female students may face additional domestic responsibilities in some cultural contexts, limiting sleep time
    
    - **Campus Safety**: Concerns about safety, particularly for female students, may impact evening study schedules and commuting times
    
    - **Housing Arrangements**: Different housing arrangements by gender may impact sleep environment quality

    These findings suggest:
    
    - Sleep education programs that address gender-specific barriers to adequate rest
    - Campus safety initiatives to reduce commute-related stress, particularly for female students

    3. **Universal Pressure**: Both genders experience the psychological burden of high academic achievement, with similar upward trends in depression rates.
    
    ### Contextual Interpretation
    
    These findings reflect unique aspects of the Indian educational environment:
    
    - **Performance Pressure**: The intense competition in Indian higher education creates psychological burden for high-performing students

  ## Key Insights from Multi-Factor Analysis
  
  1. **Compounding Effects**: Multiple risk factors show higher depression rates than single factors alone, with all risk factors combined reaching a concerning 92% depression rate.
  
  2. **Financial Stress as Central Factor**: Combinations involving financial stress consistently show the highest depression rates, confirming it as the most critical factor.
  
  3. **Sleep-Diet Relationship**: Poor sleep combined with unhealthy diet shows a stronger association with depression (79%) than either factor alone, suggesting they may influence each other.
  
  4. **High Achievement Paradox**: The combination of high CGPA with other stressors shows particularly high depression rates, reinforcing the counterintuitive finding about academic achievement in the Indian context.
  
  ### Causality vs. Correlation
  
  While these findings show strong associations between multiple factors and depression, I acknowledge the limitations in establishing causality:
  
  - **Bidirectional Relationships**: Depression might lead to some of these behaviors, creating feedback loops
  - **Unmeasured Variables**: Factors like personality traits or family support might influence both risk factors and depression
  - **Complex Interactions**: Some factors might mediate or moderate the effects of others
  
  Further research with longitudinal designs would be needed to establish causal relationships definitively.
